## Namespace

As you surely noticed ItemsAdder uses **namespaces** to identify most of the things it manages.  
A **namespace** is a **group** of elements, in this case a group of items/blocks/mobs...   
With namespaces you can easily understand where a particular item, sound, blocks.. comes from.

### Example

All **realcraft** items are under the **realcraft** namespace, so when you use the `/iaget` command you can see all items IDs start with `realcraft:`
