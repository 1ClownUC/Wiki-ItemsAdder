# items\_packså’Œresource\_pack

## What are these folders?

### items\_packs

is a folder which contains a set of folders, each one of these folders contains separated and organized **.yml** files which contains items behaviour, setting, enchant, recipe, loot... everything that's dynamic and has to do with it's creation.  
You can see that each folder name in **items\_packs** is the [namespace ]()of the items it contains.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Namespace is also set inside the .yml file itself, don't forget to set it.
{% endhint %}

### resource\_pack

is a folder which contains an automatically generated resourcepack.  
You can see this folder and **items\_packs** as a very similar thing, but **resource\_pack** folder contains the "graphical" part of all items \(and also sounds, GUIs...\).  
This folder is automatically compressed to a file named **pack.zip**, the one that will be sent to players.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember to always maintain order in **resource\_pack** folder, don't paste things randomly, don't create too many subfolders, don't leave unused textures/models or it will be difficult to find out errors and mistakes.  
Remember that please.
