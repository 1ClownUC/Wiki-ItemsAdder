Mobs are still in beta, please don't ask for support nor for tutorials, surely I will rework how they are managed in files and stuff,

## Methods to create custom mobs

ItemsAdder offers two ways of creating custom mobs:

### ItemsAdder interal

This is the easiest and fastest way to create your custom mobs and see them around the world.  
You don't need to install MythicMobs.

### Using MythicMobs

This is a bit harder and not for beginners. You need to install [MythicMobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%94-mythicmobs-free-version-%E2%96%BAthe-1-custom-mob-creator%E2%97%84.5702/).  
This will allow you to use all the extended features of MythicMobs and apply a custom model to your custom mob.
