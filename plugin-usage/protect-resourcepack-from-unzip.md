# 保护材质包不被解压

{% hint style="info" %}
With ItemsAdder you can protect your resourcepack from unzip and thieves.  
You just have to set this option in config.yml and use /iazip again.  
If you're using Dropbox don't forget to reupload the pack and update the config.yml

This is the option:

```yaml
zip:
  protect-file-from-unzip__DISABLE_IF_ANY_PROBLEM: true
```
{% endhint %}

This is a funny meme showcase of what the user will see when they try to steal your data. But this is actually what the user will see, a group of corrupted files and folders.
