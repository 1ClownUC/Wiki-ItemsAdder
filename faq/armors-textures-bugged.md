# Armors textures bugged

If you see broken textures make sure you're not using any **Optifine **shader which edits armors rendering.

If yes you have to disable the **Optifine **shaders temporarily or temporarily live with the issue.

I already contacted Optifine developer about this: [https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/6391](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/6391)
